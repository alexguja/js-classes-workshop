## Classes and Prototypes

The first exercise involves creating a class in the simplest way possible. Note this is not the idiomatic way of creating a class, however, it is a good way to understand the underlying principles of classes in JavaScript.

### Key Points

- In JavaScript, a class is a set of objects that inherit properties from the same prototype object.
- The prototype object is the central feature of a class.
- The simplest JavaScript class is defined as a function that returns an object.
